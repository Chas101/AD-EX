1. Create Domain Controller VM (DC-1)

2. Create Client VM (Client-1)

Create a Windows 10 VM named "Client-1" using the same Resource Group and Vnet as DC-1.
Ensure that both VMs are in the same Vnet.

Login to Client-1 with Remote Desktop and ping DC-1â€™s private IP address.
Enable ICMPv4 in the local Windows Firewall on DC-1 to allow ping.

4. Install Active Directory on DC-1

Install Active Directory Domain Services on DC-1.
Promote DC-1 as a domain controller and set up a new forest (e.g., mydomain.com).
Restart DC-1 and log back in as user: mydomain.com\labuser.

5. Create Admin and Normal User Accounts in AD

In Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC), create an Organizational Unit (OU) called "_EMPLOYEES" and another OU named "_ADMINS".
Create a new employee named "Jane Doe" with the username "jane_admin" and add her to the "Domain Admins" Security Group.
Logout and log back into DC-1 as "mydomain.com\jane_admin".

6. Join Client-1 to the Domain

Set Client-1's DNS settings to the DC's Private IP address from the Azure Portal.
Restart Client-1 from the Azure Portal.
Login to Client-1 using Remote Desktop as the original local admin (labuser) and join it to the domain.
Verify Client-1 shows up in Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) inside the "Computers" container on the root of the domain.
